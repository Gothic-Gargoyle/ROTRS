# TODO:

## GENERAL:
- Fix render distance from (apparantly) 250m to max
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline for this mission. (having to manually save and commit every time I finish a task is annoying and not intuitive)
- set up sectors at the bridges to capture and keep control over.
- set up sectors on various towns, settlements and radio towers to control over
- set win condition if either side captures ALL the bridgeheads AND the other ones base
## BLUEFOR:
- more aircraft at bluefor base

## OPFOR:
- Add actual opfor ground targets to shoot at!
- Fix bridgeheadsectors to become actual tasks


# rework
 After feedback from friends i decided to rework the mission to make it less of an arcade and more of an actual mission.

## mission rundown
- Begin mission at insert point in North west of map
- Go to castle ruins (Join up with local forces) to gain intel about SAM sites around airfield
- Destroy SAM sites
- Capture airfield to gain some limited nato supplies (no respawns) (airdrops happen even if SAM sites are not disabled), 
- Eventually execute general with extreme prejudice.

OPTIONAL: capture a bridge, establish FOB at other side of river to enable respawn point closer to final objective.sd
